# Advent of Code 2021
My solutions for the Advent of Code 2021 solved with [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).

## What is the Advent of Code?
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) is an online event created by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl).
It is like an advent calendar with small chocolates but replaced with small, christmas-themed coding challenges,
one for each day until Christmas. They typically get more difficult with each day.
You can solve them in any language you like.
