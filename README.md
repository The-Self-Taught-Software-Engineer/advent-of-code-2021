# Advent of Code 2021

My solutions for the Advent of Code 2021 solved with [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).

## What is the Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) is an online event created
by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl). It is like an advent calendar with small chocolates but replaced with
small, christmas-themed coding challenges, one for each day until Christmas. They typically get more difficult with each
day. You can solve them in any language you like.

### Task

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second
puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!

Your instincts tell you that in order to save Christmas, you'll need to get all fifty stars by December 25th.
